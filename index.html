            <h3>To Verify</h3>
            <p>A must to ensure we are providing value, yet;</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="fragment">
                This often happens haphazardly and is performed inconsistently.
              </li>
              <li class="fragment">
                It is onerous to record the how or what of manual verifications.
              </li>
              <li class="fragment">It is difficult to verify whether any shortcuts were taken.</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                Verification is the process of validating that your software does what it is
                required to do. Without verification, we lack confidence that we are able to deliver
                what our customer needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                When verification is done manually we risk not having the proper verification taking
                place, or having it not done correctly.
              </p>
              <p>With automated verification (testing):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A single test run will consistently perform all tests and can even automatically
                  trigger them happening on code changes/pushes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The test runner can provide a record of the steps & verifications performed and
                  identify any failed verifications.
                </li>
                <li>The test runner will run verifications the same way every time.</li>
              </ul>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>To Protect</h3>
            <p>Tests can protect us from value loss by validating:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="fragment">Previously delivered functionality still functions.</li>
              <li class="fragment">Previously fixed bugs have not been reintroduced.</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                When software of value has been created, there is always the potential for that
                value to be lost as new functionality is added.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can have automated tests triggered on code pushes, or run them manually at any
                time to have quick feedback before value loss makes it to a customer.
              </p>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>To Document</h3>
            <p>Tests are living documentation:</p>
            <ul style="display: block">
              <li class="fragment">Functional tests document use cases.</li>
              <li class="fragment">Unit tests document design.</li>
              <li class="fragment">Gives examples of how to use your exposed APIs.</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Documentation is vital, but often does not track with new changes.</p>
              <p>
                When your tests serve as documentation, they are guaranteed to never go out of date!
              </p>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>To Design</h3>
            <p>Tests can provide timely feedback on your design:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="fragment">Hard to write tests often indicate bad designs.</li>
              <li class="fragment">
                With TDD, you can get feedback about your design before you've sunk time into
                implementing it.
              </li>
              <li class="fragment">
                You can see the dependencies and data types of your design within the tests.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Hard test design smells:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Too many dependencies implies your code has too many responsibilities.</li>
                <li>
                  Too many tests for a particular API implies that it is probably doing too much.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If engaging your API feels weird, it might mean a name change is in order, or the
                  parameters should be extracted into their own type.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>To Focus</h3>
            <p>Using tests to guide what you do can help focus work:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="fragment">
                Starting with a functional test can let you know when core functionality is done.
              </li>
              <li class="fragment">
                You can stub out failing unit tests for the pieces of functionality that have to be
                written.
              </li>
              <li class="fragment">Failing tests can identify work left to be done.</li>
              <li class="fragment">
                Flesh out the unit test you want to work on first and then write just enough code to
                make it pass to reduce wasteful coding.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                Working on new functionality can get overwhelming when the functionality is complex.
                Using tests to guide what you do next can help tame the complexity beast.
              </p>
              <p>
                This helps to focus work on what is needed to meet the current needs instead of
                future possibilities.

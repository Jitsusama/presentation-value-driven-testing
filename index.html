          Why should we bother writing (automated) tests?

        <h3>To Verify</h3>
        <p>A must to ensure we are providing value, yet;</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">This often happens haphazardly and is performed inconsistently.</li>
          <li class="fragment">It is onerous to record the how or what of manual verifications.</li>
          <li class="fragment">It is difficult to verify whether any shortcuts were taken.</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          <div style="font-size: medium">
            <p>
              Without verification we lack confidence that we delivered the customer's needs. When
              done manually we risk not having the proper verification taking place.
            </p>
            <p>With automated tests, you can navigate these murky waters:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                With programmatically defined tests, a single run will consistently perform all
                tests and can even automatically trigger them happening on code changes/pushes.
              </li>
              <li>
                The programmatic tests will document the steps & verifications performed and also
                provide a report of any that failed.
              </li>
              <li>
                The programmatic test runner will consistently run tests the same way every time.
              </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>To Protect</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left">Tests can protect us from value loss by validating:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">Previously delivered functionality still functions.</li>
          <li class="fragment">Previously fixed bugs have not been reintroduced.</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          <p>When software of value has been created, there is always the potential for that value
            to be lost.</p>
          <p>You can have automated tests triggered on code pushes, or run them manually at any time
            to have quick feedback before value loss makes it to a customer.</p>
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>To Document</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left;">Documentation is vital, but often does not track with new
          changes. When tests are written well, they can serve as living documentation.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">For example:</p>
        <ul style="display: block">
          <li class="fragment">Functional tests document use cases.</li>
          <li class="fragment">Unit tests document design.</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          <p>When your tests serve as documentation, they are guaranteed to never go out of
            date!</p>

          <p>They can show others how to use your software's API, and when written well, can read
            like a narrative showing the dependencies, use cases and giving examples of how to
            engage with your software.</p>

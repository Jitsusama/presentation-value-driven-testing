                This often happens haphazardly and is performed inconsistently.
              </li>
              <li class="fragment">
                It is onerous to document the how or what of performed
                verifications.
              </li>
              <li class="fragment">
                It is difficult to verify whether any shortcuts were taken.

              <div style="font-size: medium">
                <p>
                  Without verification we lack confidence that we delivered the
                  customer's needs. When done manually we risk not having the
                  proper verification taking place.

                  With automated tests, you can navigate these murky waters:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    With programmatically defined tests, a single run will
                    consistently perform all tests and can even automatically
                    trigger them happening on code changes/pushes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The programmatic tests will document the steps &
                    verifications performed and also provide a report of any
                    that failed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The programmatic test runner will consistently run tests the
                    same way every time.
